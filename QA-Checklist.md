Testing Notes

Mobile performance (70/100) primarily due to:

Unoptimized images (no WebP format)
Missing lazy loading on images
Missing width/height attributes causing layout shift
Multiple CSS file requests


Accessibility score strong (95/100) but improvable:

Some images missing alt text
Mobile navigation missing on motion-graphics.html


SEO score good (91/100) but needs:

Meta descriptions on all pages
Favicon implementation


Mobile navigation critical issues:

Missing entirely on motion-graphics.html
"Next Project" button hidden on mobile across all project pages


Performance optimization opportunities:

Convert images to WebP format
Add lazy loading attributes
Add width/height to prevent layout shift
Consolidate CSS files
Remove duplicate JavaScript
